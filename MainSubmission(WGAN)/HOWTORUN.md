To view images generated by WGAN model 
- Open GAN/MainSubmission(WGAN) directory
- Run python .\ImageViewer.py

To train model 
- Open GAN/MainSubmission(WGAN) directory
- Run python .\WGANTrain.py

Pretrained models are in WorkingModels Folder.
Currently Training model is in TrainingModels Folder.

Training Images are in Training Folder.

To add another dataset for training add a folder to training folder with images in it.

To load_model for training add it to trainingModels folder and set LOAD_MODEL to True in WGANTrain.py.
For training a new model set LOAD_MODEL to False. (IT WILL OVERWRITE PREVIOUS MODEL!!!)

Networks.py contains the model classes

Some plots are saved to Figures Folder
